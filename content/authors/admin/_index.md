I’m a computer science PhD student at Goethe University, in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. I’m both part of [Gemma Roig’s lab](http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/index.html) and the [Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience](https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/) (*in Cooperation with Max Planck Society*).

My current research focuses on studying how AI systems abstract semantic knowledge from unimodal and multimodal sources of information.

I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects and developing research software related to machine learning and data science more broadly.
